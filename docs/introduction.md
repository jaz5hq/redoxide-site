# Introduction

This is a collection of code snippets that I have used before to solve various problems.
It is not much but I would like to keep these as a reference as I may need them in future. (Yes, I am a Ctrl+C & Ctrl+V engineer.). 

There are some basic tutorial here but the focus may be on unnoticed point which I feel enlightened when I understood which step I have mistaken or skipped. (Yep, most of the time I just don't even have basic knowledge.) Hopefully there are some trival posts that might help you. 

Cheers.
