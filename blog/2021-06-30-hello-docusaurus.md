Few days ago, I came accross to this static site generator - [**Docusaurus 2**](https://docusaurus.io/) while looking for a solution to host the working company API documentation. (Yep, because I don't like the old style CHM that is used by the company previously and want to propose a good looking documentation.)

At the same time, I feel that the coding notes that I have written in markdown look kinda simple, hence: 

**Docusaurus, I CHOOSE YOU !**

<!--truncate-->

Having a lot of trivial information in my coding notes. I want to share or put here to keep a reference. Yes, I am forgetful person. Sometimes I also lost my reasoning why I came to this decision for the implementation. This can probably help me keep tracked of this.

Hope these notes can help you. :)
